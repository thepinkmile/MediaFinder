# Media Finder
This is an application to help locate and export any media files.
It can be used to migrate your existing content to another machine.
This tool can be useful if your source machine has files stored in "unusual" places (e.g. %APPDATA%, C:\Windows\xxx, C:\SomeDirectory).

## Features
- Discovers all files located in directories specified in the SearchSettings
- Discovers files within known archives (e.g. *.zip, *.tar.gz, ...)
- Allows for deep inspection of files
  - To detect correct media type regardless of file extension
- Enables basic initial filtering based on minimum width/height
  - [USE-CASE] - I don't want any application Icons to be exported
  - [USE-CASE] - I only want files created by my phone/camera (has known dimensions)
- Once discovered, allows for quick filtering and reviewing of discovered content
